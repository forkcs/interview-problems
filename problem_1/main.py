# This problem was recently asked by Microsoft:
#
# You are given two linked-lists representing two non-negative integers.
# The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain
# a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.
#
#
# Example:
# Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
# Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8
# Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.
