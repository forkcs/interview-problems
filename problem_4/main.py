# This problem was recently asked by AirBNB:
#
# Given a sorted array, A, with possibly duplicated elements, find the indices of the first and last occurrences of a
# target element, x. Return -1 if the target is not found.
#
# Examples:
# Input: lst = [1,3,3,5,7,8,9,9,9,15], target = 9
# Output: (6, 8)
#
# Input: lst = [100, 150, 150, 153], target = 150
# Output: (1, 2)
#
# Input: lst = [1,2,3,4,5,6,10], target = 9
# Output: (-1, -1)
