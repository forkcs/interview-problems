# This problem was recently asked by Google:
#
# Given a singly-linked list, reverse the list. This can be done iteratively or recursively.
# Can you get both solutions?
#
# Example:
# Input: 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0 -> NULL
# Output: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> NULL


class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, x: int):
        self.val = x
        self.next = None


def reverse_singly_linked_list_iteratively(node: ListNode) -> ListNode:
    """Solution in O(?) time, O(?) space."""

    pass


def reverse_singly_linked_list_recursively(node: ListNode) -> ListNode:
    """Solution in O(?) time, O(?) space."""

    pass
